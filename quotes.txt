Philosophy aims at the logical clarification of thoughts. Philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity

Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
A serious and good philosophical work could be written consisting entirely of jokes
Keep it logically awesome
